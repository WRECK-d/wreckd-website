WREC'kd is an Incorporated Society in Aotearoa that promotes endurance and adventure running activities in New Zealand's hills and mountains. 

We put on events for our members, and collaborate with others doing like-minded things.

## Princples

We are part of nature, not separate.
We embrace the challenge.
In the hills, we respect the ngahere and whenua. We back each other.

## Committee

WREC'kd has a committee.
