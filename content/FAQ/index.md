## \[Frequently] Asked Questions

### How is this different from BSR (Big Sunday Runs)?

WREC'kd is a (slightly) organised group. BSR is a state of mind.

### I know trail running!?
Call it running if you like? Adventure running, endurance running...for hours in the wilderness.

### Why an Inc.?
Chores and admin. WREC'kd hosts grassroots activities for its members. We collaborate with people and groups doing cool things!

### What events?
We exist to bring back the classic 'Martini' events, and other recreation in the hills!\
Check out our [fixtures](https://wreckd.runs.nz/fixtures/) page.\

These look like races? There is a start, a finish and an elapsed time.
It is also time on feet shared and solo.


### What about rules?
Our participants are expected to know their limits in the backcountry. 
WREC'kd events can be a means to expand your skills when running the hills. 
Safety is a collective responsibility. 

### How are subs set?
Subs are set by the committee so our members can participate in our fixtures.
We may only charge a reasonable recovery of costs for any events. 

### Love it! How can I help?
WREC'kd is not a registered charity. You can help by engaging in our pursuits, or support us by volunteering.

### I'm financial member, but can't make an event?
