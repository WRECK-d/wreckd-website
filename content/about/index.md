WREC'kd is an Incorporated Society in Aotearoa that promotes endurance and adventure running activities in New Zealand's hills and mountains. 

We put on events for our members and support the Big Sunday Runs kaupapa.

## Philosphy

### Kaitiakitanga
People are part of nature, not seperate from it. We roam the tracks, ridges and riverbeds. We have a special connection to the Wellington ngahere, the Aorangi, Remutaka and Tararua.  

### Manaakitanga
We find both freedom and purpose in the wilderness and want to help others find their path to the backcountry, whatever their level of experience.

### Whanaungatanga
We honour the rich history of the hills, and work towards the preservation of these landscapes. We share suffering in the pursuit of adventure.

### Manawaroa
We are a community of shared struggle and ambition.


## Committee

WREC'kd has a committee.
