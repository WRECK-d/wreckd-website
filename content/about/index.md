WREC'kd is an Incorporated Society in Aotearoa that promotes endurance and adventure running activities in New Zealand's hills and mountains. 

We put on events for our members and support the Big Sunday Runs philosophy.

## Philosphy

### Kaitiakitanga*
We live for the hills and would live *in the hills* if we could. We roam the tracks, ridges and riverbeds. We have a special connection to the Wellington hills, and the Aorangi, Remutaka and Tararua ranges.  

### Manaakitanga*
We find both freedom and purpose in the hills and want to help others find their path to the backcountry.

### Whanaungatanga*
We look after one another and the environment. We honour the history of these places.

### Manawaroa*
We are a community of shared struggle and ambition. 

## Committee

WREC'kd has a committee.
