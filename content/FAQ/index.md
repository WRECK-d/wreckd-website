## \[Frequently] Asked Questions

### How is this different from BSR (Big Sunday Runs)?

Adventure running, endurance running, running for hours in the Wilderness. 
Pushing the boundary of possibility.

### Why an Inc.?
Admin! WREC'kd hosts grassroots for its members.

### What about rules?

WREC'kd events can be a means to expand your skills when running the hills. 
Safety is a collective responsibility. 

### How are subs set?
Subs are set by committee, so our members can participate in our fixtures.
We can only charge a reasonable recovery of costs for any events.
